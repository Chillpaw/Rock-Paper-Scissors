# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

Welcome to my Rock-Paper-Scissors game, developed as part of The Odin Project. This project marks my initial exploration into JavaScript programming. Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game played between two people, where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible outcomes are rock crushing scissors, scissors cutting paper, and paper covering rock.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
4. Enter your choice as "rock," "paper," or "scissors" when prompted.
5. The computer will randomly select its choice.
6. The winner of each round will be displayed.
7. The game continues until one player reaches three points.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that includes the game structure.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the game interface.

## Game Logic

- The game follows a best-of-five format.
- Player and computer selections are displayed for each round.
- Points are awarded based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
- The game ends when one player reaches three points.

## Development Notes

- This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum.
- It serves as an introduction to JavaScript programming.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance your JavaScript skills.
